# Interaction Styles UI Demo

A modern, interactive web application that demonstrates **three fundamental user interaction styles**:
**Mouse**, **Keyboard**, and **Touch Gestures** — all in one clean, responsive interface.

This project was built to understand and visualize how different user inputs are handled in real-world user interfaces.
